# 3-D-Newspaper-Prototype
When we read newspapers on the screen, it appears in 2D. We access the pages/news items through scrolling and
clicks. However, the real-world newspapers are 3D entities with 3D manipulation of pages. Systems like Kindle
attempts to make the reading experience closer to reality. In this project, we try to explore somewhat different onscreen
news reading experiencing by making the following changes:
1. Show the digital newspaper in the form of a polyhedron. The number of surfaces may be equal to the
number of headlines.
2. The polyhedron should be manipulated interactively (through mouse gestures).
3. The reader should be able to interactive access the surfaces of the polyhedron (i.e., the headlines) and
zoom in/out the news under each headline.
